# Tasks Directory

This directory contains task tracking for work in progress. These files are not committed to git - they're used as PR descriptions when work is complete.

## Usage

1. Create a new task file when starting work (e.g., `variable-standardization.md`)
2. Use the template in `TASK-TEMPLATE.md`
3. Update the file as you work
4. Copy the content to your PR description when ready to submit
5. Delete the task file after PR is created

## Note

Task files are in `.gitignore` - they're temporary work tracking only.
