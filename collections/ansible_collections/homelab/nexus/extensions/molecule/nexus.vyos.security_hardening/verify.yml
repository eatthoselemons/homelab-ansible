          Security hardening test completed. In a real environment, the following would be verified:
          - Admin user 'secadmin' created with SSH key authentication
          - Default vyos user removed
          - Firewall configured with default-deny policies
          - SSH hardened on port 2222
          - Fail2ban configured and running
          
          Note: Full verification requires VyOS API connectivity which is not available in container test
